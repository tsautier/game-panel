# 🐳 OVHcloud Game Panel Docker Images

This directory holds the Docker image sources maintained alongside OVHcloud Game Panel — the game server runtimes it deploys, and the panel's own operational images.

## 🎮 Game server images

| Image family | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minecraft | `minecraft/` | Minecraft Java and Bedrock server runtimes. |
| Hytale | `hytale/` | Runtime image for prepared Hytale dedicated server files. |
| Counter-Strike 2 | `counter-strike/2/` | CS2 dedicated server runtime with optional framework support. |
| Palworld | `palworld/` | Palworld dedicated server runtime. |
| Project Zomboid | `project-zomboid/` | Project Zomboid dedicated server runtime. |
| Rust | `rust/` | Rust dedicated server runtime. |

## 🛠️ Game Panel images

| Image | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Game Panel Updater | `gamepanel/updater/` | One-shot runtime used to update an installed panel. |

## ⚙️ Common runtime model

Game server images follow the same general conventions:

- persistent game data is stored in `/data`;
- backup data is stored in `/backups` when the image supports a dedicated backup mount;
- runtime state is stored in `/run/...` and is not meant to be persisted;
- game server containers run as the `gameserver` user with UID/GID `10001`;
- logs are written to stdout and stderr;
- health checks are lightweight and local to the container;
- operational actions are exposed through small scripts under `/app`.
