OVHcloud Game Panel is an **open-source, self-hosted** control panel to deploy, run, and monitor your game servers — **without ever touching the command line**. Spin up a Minecraft, Counter-Strike 2, Hytale, Palworld, Project Zomboid, or Rust server in a few clicks, then manage its files, backups, player access, and performance from a single modern dashboard. 🚀

## ✨ Features

- 🎛️ Complete server lifecycle management (create, start, stop, restart…).
- 📊 Live status, logs, metrics, and installation tracking.
- 🕹️ Interactive in-browser game console.
- 📁 Powerful built-in file manager.
- 💾 One-click backups and restores.
- ⏰ Flexible task scheduling.
- 🐳 Advanced container configuration.
- 🔐 Fine-grained user permissions.
- 📈 Real-time host monitoring.

## 🕹️ Supported games

## 🚀 Installation

## 🏗️ Architecture

Under the hood, a **React + Vite** frontend talks to a **Node.js** backend (Express, WebSocket, SQLite) that orchestrates the full server lifecycle — files, backups, permissions, metrics, and container configuration — through the **Docker** engine.

- `frontend/` — React and Vite user interface.
- `backend/` — Node.js, Express, WebSocket, and SQLite backend.
- `docker-images/` — OVHcloud game server images and operational images.
- `deploy/` — self-hosted installation and update scripts.
